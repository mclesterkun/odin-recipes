            <li>½ pouch (12g) jelly powder (gulaman) - use green if available.
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>6-8 pieces Pandan leaves - or use pandan extracts (see Note 2)</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 pack (250mL) all-purpose cream - or table cream / whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 cups coconut meat - shredded into strips</li>
            <li>½ cup tapioca pearls - uncooked</li>
            <li>1 bottle (12oz) kaong (sugar palm fruit) - syrup drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 bottle (12oz) nata de coco (coconut gel) - syrup drained and rinsed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, add 3 cups of coconut juice and dissolve the 12g jelly powder or gulaman. Add ½ cup of sugar and pandan leaves(6-8pcs) and bring it to boil while stirring constantly. </li>
            <li>Once it boils, remove from heat and pour into a square pan and let cool to set. You may place it in the fridge to fasten the process. Once ready, cut the gelatin into cubes.</li>
            <li>While waiting, cook the tapioca pearls(½). In a pot, bring 1 liter of water to boil. Add the small sago or tapioca pearls and cook for 15 minutes or until translucent. (Check package instructions.) Stir occasionally to prevent from sticking together. </li>
            <li>Turn off heat and strain the sago pearls using a fine sieve. Rinse thoroughly until the sago or tapioca pearls are no longer hot to touch. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a big bowl, add 250ml all-purpose cream and 1 can(14oz) condensed milk and stir until well blended.  Add 2 cups of coconut strips, tapioca pearls, pandan jelly cubes, 1 bottle(12oz) each of kaong and nata de coco and gently mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl and leave it in the fridge to chill or transfer to another container if planning to freeze.</li>
        </ol>
